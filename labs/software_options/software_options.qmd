## Setting the scene

The aim of this practical is to recreate the nimble model in the `hierarchical_modelling` lab using INLA.
As a reminder, here is the model again.

```{.R}
nimbleCode({
  # priors
  alpha ~ dnorm(0, 5)
  sigma_p ~ T(dnorm(0, 1), 0, Inf)

  for (j in 1:Np) {
    theta[j] ~ dnorm(0, sd = sigma_p)
  }

  # likelihood
  for (i in 1:N) {
    y[i] ~ dpois(mu[i])
    log(mu[i]) <- log(E[i]) + alpha + theta[province[i]]
  }
})
```

And let's load in the data.
```{r}
data <- read_rds(here("data", "italy", "italy_mortality.rds"))

data <- data |>
  filter(year == 2018) |>
  filter(month == 9) |>
  arrange(SIGLA)
```

```{r}
shp_italy <- read_rds(here("data", "italy", "italy_shp.rds")) |> arrange(SIGLA)

ggplot(aes(fill = mean.pop), data = shp_italy) +
  geom_sf(colour = "white") +
  scale_fill_continuous_sequential(palette = "Blues3") +
  theme_void()
```

## Writing the model in INLA

INLA specifies the model in a formula, much like `glm` in base `R`.
For a simple IID random effect for each province, we can write the model as
```{r}
formula_iid <- deaths ~ 1 + f(SIGLA, model = "iid")
```

This means we have an intercept signified by `1`.
This is the equivalent of `alpha` in the nimble model.

We can run the model by calling the `inla` function.
```{r}
model <- inla(
  formula_iid,
  data = data,
  E = expected,
  family = "poisson",
  control.predictor = list(link = 1), # log-link
  control.compute = list(config = TRUE) # so that we can simulate draws of posterior
)
```

Take a moment to look at each of the arguments and convince yourself that it is the same model as nimble.

## Exploring the model in INLA

INLA often "just works".
If it runs, it has usually fitted correctly.
If it doesn't run, or it hangs, there is an issue with the model and it will let you know.

INLA has a lot of nice inbuilt functionality to explore how the model has fit.

Note, as explained in the lecture, INLA does not fit models through sampling.
It approximates the posterior distribution using Gaussian distributions (the Laplace approximation).
```{r}
summary(model)
model$summary.fixed
head(model$summary.random$SIGLA)
```

Although the model isn't fit using samples, we can use INLA to sample from the posterior.
```{r}
posterior_samples <- inla.posterior.sample(1000, model)

SMR <- inla.posterior.sample.eval(\(...) exp(`(Intercept)` + SIGLA), posterior_samples) |>
  apply(MARGIN = 1, FUN = median)
```

```{r}
tibble(precision = inla.hyperpar.sample(100, model)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = precision)) +
  geom_density()
```

Let's work out the SMR for each province and plot the output.
```{r}
shp_italy |>
  mutate(SMR = SMR) |>
  ggplot(aes(fill = SMR)) +
  geom_sf(colour = "white") +
  scale_fill_continuous_sequential(palette = "Reds") +
  theme_void()
```

## Customising the priors

The formula gives us an IID effect, but no control over the hyperprior for the variance of the effect.
INLA usually chooses some good defaults for you, but here, I will put a non-default prior on the precision (`1/sigma**2`).

```{r}
formula_iid_priors <- deaths ~ 1 + f(SIGLA, model = "iid", hyper = list(prec = list(prior = "loggamma", param = c(0.01, 0.01))))
```

```{r}
model <- inla(
  formula_iid_priors,
  data = data,
  E = expected,
  family = "poisson",
  control.predictor = list(link = 1),
  control.compute = list(config = TRUE)
)
```

## Fitting a spatial model with INLA

INLA is used widely amongst spatial statisticians.
There are a lot of inbuilt functions which make the task of inference in spatial settings very efficient.
INLA can deal with both areal data and point processes.
For more information, see the [examples](https://www.r-inla.org/examples-tutorials).

Here, we're going to fit a BYM model in place of the IID effect.

For this, INLA needs to know the spatial adjacency matrix ("graph" in INLA's language).
The following code extracts the adjacency matrix from the shapefile.
```{r}
data = data |> arrange(SIGLA)
shp_italy <- shp_italy |> arrange(SIGLA)

italy_nb <- poly2nb(shp_italy,row.names = data$SIGLA)
italy_adj <- nb2INLA(file = here("data", "italy", "italy.graph"), nb = italy_nb)
```

And we can visualise the adjacency matrix.
```{r}
G <- inla.read.graph(here("data", "italy", "italy.graph"))
image(inla.graph2matrix(G), xlab = "", ylab = "") # plot adjacency matrix
```

Finally, let's use the graph in a BYM model.
```{r}
data <- data |>
  mutate(provincia_id = data |> group_by(SIGLA) |> group_indices())

formula_spatial <- deaths ~ 1 + f(provincia_id, model = "bym", graph = G)
model_spatial <- inla(
  formula_spatial,
  data = data,
  E = expected,
  family = "poisson",
  control.predictor = list(link = 1),
  control.compute = list(config = TRUE)
)
```

```{r}
summary(model_spatial)
model_spatial$summary.fixed
head(model_spatial$summary.random$provincia_id)
```

Compare and contrast the model fits using the plotting code above.
Try and test out different spatial models, such as `"besag"`.
